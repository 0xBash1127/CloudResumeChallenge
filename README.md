# Cloud Resume Challenge 

## Challenge Overview
The **Cloud Resume Challenge** is an end-to-end project designed to develop and showcase practical **cloud computing skills**. By combining **frontend development, severless technologies**, and **DevOps practices**, this challenge simulates real-world cloud enviornments and workflows.

This project not only demonstrates technical proficiency but also integrates critical skills such as:
- **Cloud Infrastructure Design:**  Hosting and managing applications in a secure, scalable environment.
- **Serverless Computing:** Implementing dynamic, cost-effective solutions using services like AWS Lambda and DynamoDB.
- **Automation and CI/CD:** Streamlining deployments with modern DevOps tools.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Building reproducible, automated infrastructure using Terraform or AWS CloudFormation.
